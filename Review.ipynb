    "You can use CNN, ANN or GNN to predict energy usage for the ASHRAE Energy Prediction Dataset on Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used for image recognition tasks, but they can also be used for time-series data analysis. You can use 1D or 2D CNNs to extract features from the temporal or spatial data in the energy usage dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is temporal or spatial Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporal data refers to data that changes over time. This type of data includes any information that can be associated with a specific time period, such as hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly measurements. Examples of temporal data include temperature readings, stock prices, and website traffic.\n",
    "Spatial data refers to data that has a geographic or spatial component. This type of data includes any information that can be associated with a specific location or area, such as the latitude and longitude of a city, the elevation of a mountain, or the shape of a building. Spatial data is often represented as maps or other visualizations that show the location and distribution of the data.\n",
    "In some cases, data can be both temporal and spatial. For example, weather data can be both temporal (changing over time) and spatial (variations across different geographic locations). Understanding the temporal and spatial characteristics of data is important for many applications, including weather forecasting, traffic analysis, and resource management.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tArtificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a type of deep learning algorithm that is commonly used for regression tasks. You can use an ANN to predict energy usage based on the features of the building, such as temperature, humidity, and airflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a type of deep learning algorithm that are used to model relationships between entities represented as nodes in a graph. If you have additional information about the building or location of the energy usage data, you can use a GNN to model the relationships between the features and predict the energy usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, all three types of neural networks can be used to predict energy usage for the ASHRAE Energy Prediction Dataset on Kaggle. The choice of algorithm depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the problem you are trying to solve.\n",
